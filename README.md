# Ollama Models Search
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ollama-models-search)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ollama-models-search)

A TypeScript package that retrieves a list of Ollama models, including metadata such as name, description, pull count, last updated date, and available versions.

## How it works
The package scrapes the Ollama websiteâ€™s search page by sending queries and parsing the HTML response to extract model information.

## Features

- Search for Ollama AI models by query
- Filter models by categories (Thinking, Embedding, Vision, Tools)
- Sort results by newest or most popular
- Get detailed model information including descriptions, pull counts, and versions
- TypeScript support with included type definitions

## Installation

```bash
npm install ollama-models-search
```

## Usage

### Basic Search

```typescript
import { searchOllamaModels } from 'ollama-models-search';

// Search for models
const models = await searchOllamaModels();
console.log(models);
```

### Advanced Search with Filters

```typescript
import { searchOllamaModels, Category, Order } from 'ollama-models-search';

// Search with filters and sorting
const filteredModels = await searchOllamaModels({
  query: 'llama',
  categories: [Category.Thinking, Category.Vision],
  order: Order.Newest
});

console.log(filteredModels);
```
## Response Example
```
[
    {
        "name": "deepseek-r1",
        "description": "DeepSeek-R1 is a family of open reasoning models with performance approaching that of leading models, such as O3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.",
